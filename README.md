# Libraries:

## @reduxjs/toolkit: This is a package that simplifies Redux setup by providing utilities to write Redux logic in a more concise way. It includes functions for creating reducers, actions, and configuring the Redux store.


## react-redux: It's the official React binding for Redux. It enables the usage of Redux with React by providing components like Provider to pass the store to React components and connect to connect React components to the Redux store.


## redux-thunk: It's a middleware for Redux that enables handling asynchronous actions. Thunks are functions that can delay the dispatch of an action or perform conditional dispatch based on the state.


## axios: A popular promise-based HTTP client for making HTTP requests in browsers and Node.js. It supports features like interceptors, transforming requests and responses, and handling errors easily.

## leaflet: A leading open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps. It provides various mapping functionalities and is customizable with a wide range of plugins.


## react-leaflet: It's a React wrapper for Leaflet, allowing easy integration of Leaflet maps into React applications by providing components that can be used declaratively within React components.


## react-paginate: A pagination component for React. It helps in creating paginated views by providing components to handle pagination logic and UI elements.


Each of these libraries serves specific purposes in building web applications, from managing state (Redux) to handling asynchronous operations (axios, thunk), and integrating interactive maps (Leaflet, react-leaflet), or managing pagination (react-paginate) in React applications.

##To do list:

- Create "ListView.jsx" component for list view,

- Create "MapView.jsx" component for map view,

- Switch between these two views in "App.js",
